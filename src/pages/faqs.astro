    questions: [
      {
        question: "What are the requirements to start flight training?",
        answer: "To begin training, you simply need to be a U.S. citizen (or complete TSA clearance) and be able to read, speak, and understand English. To solo, you must be at least 16 years old and hold a Student Pilot Certificate and FAA Medical Certificate."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you offer financing for flight school?",
        answer: "Yes. We partner with <strong>Stratus Financial</strong> to offer funding options for our students. We also offer competitive 'pay-as-you-go' rates if you prefer not to take out a loan."
      },
      {
        question: "How long does it take to get a Private Pilot License?",
        answer: "The FAA minimum is 40 hours, but the national average is closer to 60-70 hours. At MH Aviation, our open schedule and structured maintenance availability often allow students to finish closer to the minimums than at busy, congested schools."
      },
      {
        question: "Why should I train at Fox Field (KWJF) instead of LA?",
        answer: "Fox Field offers less air traffic congestion, meaning you spend less time taxiing and holding, and more time flying. Additionally, the high desert winds provide excellent training conditions to master crosswind landings."

    category: "Maintenance (Part 145)",
    questions: [
      {
        question: "What specific maintenance services do you offer?",
        answer: "As an FAA Part 145 Repair Station (#MHAR0094E), we offer Annual Inspections, 100-hour inspections, sheet metal repairs, major airframe repairs, and avionics upgrades (specifically Garmin G5 glass cockpit installations)."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you offer pre-purchase inspections?",
        answer: "Yes. Our President, Jeff Haney, frequently travels to perform pre-buy inspections to ensure the aircraft you are buying is safe and worth the investment."
      },
      {
        question: "What is your hourly labor rate?",
