## How Long Does It Usually Take to Get a Multi-Engine Checkride Scheduled?

You can finish all your multi-engine training, be fully ready for the checkride, and still end up waiting weeks or even months.

At many flight schools, that delay is considered normal.

## Why Checkride Delays Are So Common

In most parts of the country, there are:

- Very few Designated Pilot Examiners (DPEs)  
- A limited number of multi-engine aircraft (that actually work)  
- A backlog that rarely disappears  

So what usually happens?

You finish training. Your instructor signs you off. And then you wait. Or worse, you get a date, and the airplane breaks the day before.

Two weeks turns into four. Four turns into eight.

While you are waiting:

- Skills start to get rusty  
- Refresher flights become necessary  
- Costs go up  

## What “Normal” Looks Like at Most Schools

At many flight schools, a **3 to 8 week wait** for a multi-engine checkride is completely normal.

In high-demand areas, it can be even worse. Often, the delay isn't just the examiner—it's the airplane. Multi-engine aircraft like twins are complex and maintenance-heavy. Most schools rely on outside mechanics, meaning if a prop governor acts up, you are grounded for weeks.

## How MH Aviation Is Different

This is one of the major structural advantages of training at **MH Aviation** in Lancaster.

We are not just a flight school; we are a **Full Service Repair and Maintenance Center**.

Our multi-engine trainer, the **Piper PA-30 Twin Comanche (N8267Y)**, is maintained by our own family-run shop.

That changes the entire process.

- **Mechanical Readiness:** If a squawk comes up before your checkride, our team (led by Michael Haney, Chief Inspector) is right there to address it.  
- **Scheduling:** We use **Flight Schedule Pro** to ensure you and the aircraft are ready when the examiner is available.  

In practical terms, this means we eliminate the "mechanical cancellation" loop that traps so many multi-engine students.

## Why This Matters More Than People Think

Waiting for a checkride is not just frustrating. It is expensive.

Every additional week often means:

- Extra review flights in a twin engine (which is more expensive than a single)  
- Additional instructor time  
- More money spent  

Mentally, it is also difficult to feel finished but not actually be finished.

## The Real Answer

The honest comparison looks like this:

- At many schools: **weeks of uncertainty due to maintenance and scheduling** - At MH Aviation: **Reliable aircraft and professional scheduling** It is a small structural detail—owning the maintenance shop—that makes a major difference in how fast, smooth, and predictable your multi-engine training experience is.
