## How Long Does It Usually Take to Get a Multi-Engine Checkride Scheduled?

You can finish all your multi-engine training, be fully ready for the checkride, and still end up waiting weeks or even months for an examiner.

At many flight schools, that delay is considered normal.

## Why Checkride Delays Are So Common

In most parts of the country, there are:

- Very few Designated Pilot Examiners  
- A large number of students competing for the same limited slots  
- A backlog that rarely disappears  

So what usually happens?

You finish training. Your instructor signs you off. And then you wait.

Two weeks turns into four. Four turns into eight. Sometimes longer.

While you are waiting:

- Skills start to get rusty  
- Refresher flights become necessary  
- Schedules get disrupted  
- Overall timelines slip  

This is one of the most common hidden delays in pilot training.

## What “Normal” Looks Like at Most Schools

At many flight schools, a **3 to 8 week wait** for a multi-engine checkride is completely normal.

In high-demand areas, it can be even worse.

Even if training itself was efficient, the system often slows you down right at the finish line.

## How  Is Different

This is one of the major structural advantages of the  program.

At , both the owner and the chief pilot are **Designated Pilot Examiners**.

That changes the entire process.

Instead of searching for an examiner and hoping for an opening, checkrides are:

- Scheduled as part of the training flow  
- Planned in advance  
- Not dependent on outside availability  

In practical terms, this means no multi-month backlog and no waiting around for a phone call.

When you are ready, you fly.

## Why This Matters More Than People Think

Waiting for a checkride is not just frustrating. It is expensive.

Every additional week often means:

- Extra review flights  
- Additional instructor time  
- More money spent  
- More stress  

Mentally, it is also difficult to feel finished but not actually be finished.

## The Real Answer

The honest comparison looks like this:

- At many schools: **weeks or even months**  
- At : **checkrides are built into the program**, not left to chance  

It is a small structural detail that makes a major difference in how fast, smooth, and predictable your training experience is.
