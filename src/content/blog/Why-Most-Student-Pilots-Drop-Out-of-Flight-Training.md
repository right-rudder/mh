## Why Most Student Pilots Drop Out of Flight Training

Nobody starts flight training planning to quit.

People show up at the airfield excited. They post the first cockpit photo. They tell their friends they’re going to the airlines.

And then most of them disappear.

They quit because the system wears them down.

Here’s what usually goes wrong, and how **MH Aviation** in Lancaster avoids these traps.

## 1. Training Turns Into a Scheduling Nightmare

At most schools, flying is something you try to squeeze into your life. You’re juggling instructor availability, airplane availability, and weather.

Weeks turn into months between flights. You forget things. You repeat lessons.

Eventually, training feels like a hassle.

## 2. There’s No Real Plan

A lot of students are essentially told: "We’ll figure it out as we go."

There’s no clear timeline. That uncertainty is exhausting.

## 3. Instructor Turnover Kills Continuity

At many schools, students get passed around from instructor to instructor. Every new instructor teaches slightly differently.

## 4. Maintenance Delays (The Hidden Killer)

This is the big one that nobody talks about. You are motivated, the weather is good, but the plane is broken. And it stays broken for weeks because the flight school doesn't have a mechanic.

Momentum dies when the propeller stops turning.

## Why MH Aviation Is Different

**MH Aviation** exists because we believe in doing things fairly and honestly. We are family-owned and operated right here at **Gen. William Fox Airfield (KWJF)**.

## 1. We Keep the Fleet Flying

We are unique because we are an **FBO and FAA Repair Station** first.

We have a team of technicians, led by **Michael Haney**, dedicated to keeping our Cessnas and Pipers airworthy. When you schedule a flight at MH Aviation, the plane is ready. We don't rely on outside shops, so you don't wait on outside delays.

## 2. Organized Scheduling

In partnership with **Flight Schedule Pro™**, we offer online flight scheduling. You can see the schedule, book your slot, and plan your training. It puts the control back in your hands.

## 3. A Personal, Family Approach

We aren't a pilot factory. We are the Haney family.

- **Jeff Haney (President)** - **Jessica Haney (Vice President)** - **Arminta Bishop (Office Manager)** We know our clients. We tailor instruction to meet individual student needs and learning styles, fostering a supportive environment. You aren't just a number here.

## 4. Clear Costs and Value

We provide transparent rates for our aircraft:
- Cessna 172N/P models starting at **$155.00/hr (Wet)** - Multi-Engine Piper PA-30 at **$290.00/hr (Wet)** We believe in being fair and honest. No hidden fees. No surprises.

## The Real Difference

Most students don’t fail. They get worn down by a broken system.

At **MH Aviation**, we fix the system by keeping the planes fixed and treating people right.

When the aircraft works and the people care, you succeed.
