## What’s on the Multi-Engine Checkride?

If you are getting ready for your multi-engine checkride, you are probably asking one simple question:

What exactly are they going to test me on?

The good news is that it is not a mystery. The FAA spells it out clearly in the **Multi-Engine Airman Certification Standards (ACS)**.

The bad news is that many applicants never actually read it.

Let’s break it down in plain English.

## The Two Parts of the Checkride

Like every other checkride, the multi-engine ride has two required parts:

- Oral exam, the ground portion  
- Flight test, the flying portion  

You must pass both.

Both portions are driven directly by:

- The Multi-Engine ACS  
- The FARs, Federal Aviation Regulations  

## The Oral Exam

The oral exam is mostly about one core question:

Do you understand how a multi-engine airplane works, and what happens when one engine fails?

### 1. Regulations You Are Expected to Know

You do not need to memorize the entire FAR AIM, but you do need to understand how the rules apply.

Commonly tested regulations include:

- 61.123 and 61.129, eligibility and aeronautical experience  
- 61.31, type ratings and limitations  
- 91.103, preflight action  
- 91.205, required equipment  
- 91.213, inoperative equipment  
- 91.211, oxygen requirements  
- 91.175, IFR rules if instrument privileges apply  
- 91.3, PIC authority  

You will also be expected to understand:

- Certificates  
- Currency  
- Medical requirements  
- Privileges and limitations  

They are not looking for someone who can recite reg numbers. They want to know if you understand how the rules work in real flying.

### 2. Aircraft Systems

Expect detailed system questions, including:

- Engines and propellers  
- Fuel system  
- Electrical system  
- Landing gear  
- Vacuum or alternator systems  
- Fire detection and suppression, if equipped  

The key focus is this:

What is different about these systems in a twin compared to a single?

### 3. Performance and Limitations

This is where the multi-engine checkride gets serious.

You must understand:

- Vmc, minimum controllable airspeed  
- Vyse, the blue line  
- Single-engine service ceiling  
- Accelerate-stop distance  
- Accelerate-go distance  
- Critical engine  
- Factors that affect Vmc  

You will almost certainly be asked:

- What happens if you lose an engine after takeoff?  
- Can this airplane climb on one engine, and under what conditions?  

### 4. Weight and Balance and Performance

You will be expected to:

- Complete a weight and balance  
- Explain how weight, CG, and density altitude affect:  
  - Single-engine performance  
  - Vmc  
  - Climb capability  

### 5. Emergency Procedures and Decision Making

This is the heart of multi-engine flying.

You must understand:

- Engine failure during the takeoff roll  
- Engine failure after liftoff  
- Engine failure in cruise  
- Engine fire  
- When to continue, reject, or secure an engine  

Most importantly, you must understand why multi-engine accidents are often fatal when pilots make poor decisions.

## The Flight Portion

Everything you fly comes directly from the Multi-Engine ACS.

### 1. Normal Operations

You can expect:

- Normal takeoff  
- Normal landing  
- Steep turns  
- Slow flight  

### 2. Engine Failure Procedures

This is the core of the checkride.

You will perform:

- Simulated engine failure after takeoff  
- Engine failure in cruise  
- Engine shutdown and restart  
- Single-engine approaches  
- Single-engine go-around  

You must demonstrate:

- Proper aircraft control  
- Correct checklist usage  
- Correct engine identification and verification  
- Sound decision making  

### 3. Vmc Demonstration

Yes, you will perform a Vmc demonstration.

You must show:

- Proper setup  
- Proper recovery  
- Good judgment throughout the maneuver  

### 4. Performance Maneuvers

These commonly include:

- Steep turns  
- Stalls, power-on and power-off as required  
- Possibly an accelerated stall, depending on the aircraft and examiner  

### 5. Instrument Work if Applicable

If the multi-engine rating is tied to instrument privileges, expect:

- A single-engine ILS or other approach  
- An engine failure during the approach  
- A missed approach on one engine  

## What the ACS Actually Is

The ACS is literally the test.

It defines:

- What tasks may be tested  
- What knowledge areas apply  
- What risk management elements are evaluated  
- What the passing standards are  

If it is not in the ACS, it is not supposed to be on the checkride.

## Why People Fail the Multi-Engine Checkride

Most applicants do not fail because they cannot fly.

They fail because:

- They do not understand Vmc, critical engine, or single-engine aerodynamics  
- They rush or skip checklists  
- They misidentify the failed engine  
- They make poor decisions under pressure  

## The Bottom Line

The multi-engine checkride is not about being perfect.

It is about proving that you understand how dangerous a twin can be if mishandled, and that you can manage an engine failure calmly, correctly, and safely.

If you train to the ACS, understand the FARs, and truly know the airplane, it is a very fair checkride.
