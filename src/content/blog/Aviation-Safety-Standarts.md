Safety is the foundation of every successful flight. At **MH Aviation**, we believe that a great flight school starts with safe, well-maintained airplanes. It is with that mindset that we have proudly served the **Lancaster, California** community for over **35 years**. Our history began with aircraft maintenance, and that background continues to shape everything we do today.

### The Maintenance Advantage

Many flight schools must send their airplanes off-site for repairs and inspections. This often leads to downtime and limited visibility into who is working on the aircraft. At MH Aviation, we operate differently. We are a full-service **FAA Part 145 Repair Station** located directly at **William J Fox Airfield**.

Our owners, Jeff and Jessica Haney, prioritize a strong **safety mindset** above all else. Because we maintain our aircraft in-house, our maintenance team can address issues immediately. We perform **Annual Inspections** as well as scheduled inspections such as 50-hour and 100-hour checks on-site. This ensures our students train in aircraft that are consistently monitored and maintained by experienced professionals.

### Certified Technical Standards

Aviation safety standards are defined by the FAA, and we hold ourselves to the highest levels of compliance. Our maintenance facility operates under **Part 145**, which requires additional oversight, detailed documentation, and rigorous quality control compared to standard maintenance shops.

For flight training, we provide instruction under **FAA Part 61**. This structure allows us to tailor training to each student’s pace and goals while maintaining strict safety standards backed by our professional maintenance operation.

### Experience You Can Trust

MH Aviation is a family-owned business with deep roots in the aviation community. Our Chief Inspector, Michael Haney, along with our skilled technicians, ensures every aircraft meets or exceeds FAA regulations. We do not cut corners when it comes to safety.

Our team brings extensive experience in **major repairs**, **sheet metal work**, and **avionics**. We know our fleet inside and out. When you step into one of our aircraft, you can trust that it has been maintained with care, precision, and integrity.

### Modern Technology for Better Safety

Safety also depends on having the right equipment. We have invested over **$150,000** in fleet upgrades, including new **glass cockpits** and modern avionics. These improvements enhance situational awareness, reliability, and training relevance for today’s pilots.

Whether you are pursuing your **[Private Pilot License](/programs/private-pilot-and-intro-training/)** or working toward your **[Commercial](/programs/commercial-and-cfi-track/)** rating, you will train with dependable, modern equipment. Our open aircraft availability helps minimize maintenance-related delays and keeps your training moving forward.

### Committed to Excellence

We want every student to feel confident, supported, and safe. Our instructors and maintenance professionals work closely together to create an environment where safety and learning go hand in hand. We are proud to provide high-quality flight instruction and aircraft maintenance to the **Antelope Valley**.
