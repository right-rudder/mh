faq:
  upperheader: "FAQ"
  title: "Common Questions"
  qnas:
    - question: "Do I need an Instrument Rating before this course?"
      answer: "While you can technically hold a Commercial certificate without an Instrument rating, it is highly restricted (no passengers for hire at night or on cross-countries greater than 50nm). For any career path, the Instrument rating is effectively mandatory. We strongly recommend completing it before this course."
    - question: "Can I fly for an airline immediately after this course?"
      answer: "Not yet. You will have a Commercial Certificate, but airlines require 1,500 hours (ATP). Most pilots proceed to earn their CFI ratings to work as instructors and build the remaining flight time."
    - question: "Is housing included in the $35,450 cost?"
      answer: "No. Housing and pilot kits are included in the full Professional Airline Pilot Track but are not included in a la carte Part 141 courses. We can assist with local recommendations."
    - question: "What aircraft will I fly?"
      answer: "You will train in our high-quality, technologically advanced single-engine fleet, maintained by our in-house maintenance team."
