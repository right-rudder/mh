  title: "Multi-Engine Instructor (MEI) Rating"
  descriptionParagraphs:
    - "The Multi-Engine Instructor (MEI) rating is the pinnacle of flight instruction certification. At M2A Aviation Academy, we do not simply teach you to fly on two engines; we train you to teach others how to survive and thrive when one fails."
    - "This course focuses heavily on the aerodynamics of asymmetric flight, critical decision-making, and the instructional mastery required to safely teach single-engine operations in multi-engine aircraft."
    - "Designed for current CFIs looking to advance their careers, this program leverages the immense experience of our senior staff—pilots who have managed complex aircraft in Parts 91, 121, 135, and military combatant commands."

  upperheader: "Common Questions"
  title: "MEI Frequently Asked Questions"
  qnas:
    - question: "Do I need my MEI to get to the airlines?"
      answer: "Technically, no. However, having an MEI allows you to instruct in twin-engine aircraft, which is the fastest and most cost-effective way to build the required multi-engine flight time for airline hiring minimums."
    - question: "How long does the course take?"
      answer: "For a proficient CFI who is already rated in multi-engine aircraft, the course is typically completed in 1 to 2 weeks."
    - question: "Can I do this course if I trained elsewhere?"
      answer: "Yes. While we love our internal graduates, we welcome licensed pilots from other schools who meet our entry standards and professionalism requirements."
    - question: "What aircraft will I fly?"
      answer: "You will train in our fleet of well-maintained, technologically advanced multi-engine aircraft (typically Piper Seneca or similar), maintained by our top-tier maintenance team."
